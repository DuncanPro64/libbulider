Law enforcement agencies have increasingly acquired database management systems (DMBS) and geographic information systems (GIS) to support their law enforcement efforts. These agencies use such systems to monitor current crime activity and develop collaborative strategies with the local communities for combating crime. However, in general these strategies tend to be reactive rather than proactive. A more proactive approach requires early warning of impending trouble with sufficient lead-time to formulate a plan. Early warning, in turn, necessitates the development of predictive models in space and time that can inform law enforcement of impending "hot spots" and areas with declining crime activity. The focus of this proposal research is on the prediction of crime events. Prediction of this sort is now feasible because of modern data collection and analysis systems. Records management systems implemented in DBMS and GIS exist in many jurisdictions and can provide the basis for more formal analysis of local crime events. The formal analysis that I intend to develop consists of statistical mathematical model that describe the functional relationships between demographic, economic, social, victim, and spatial variables and numerous measures of criminal activity.

One unfortunate aspect of modern life is the presence of crime in every major urban area. However, while crime itself is ubiquitous, it does not appear to be uniformly distributed within space and time. For example, while some neighborhoods tend to be reasonably safe, others appear far more dangerous and display dense clusters of both property and violent crimes. Also, temporal correlations between crimes are well documented, with victims or their close neighbors often being repeatedly targeted within short periods of time. These spatio-temporal aggregates of criminal occurrences are commonly referred to as crime “hotspots,” and thanks to recent advances in mapping technology it is possible to track their evolution at fine spatial and temporal scales. The typical lifetimes and length scales of crime hotspots are observed to vary depending upon the particular geographic, economic, or seasonal conditions present. Also, depending on the specific category of crime in question, hotspots are seen to emerge, diffuse and dissipate in ways suggestive of a structured, albeit complex, underlying dynamics. Despite this wealth of data, the efforts of law enforcement agencies towards utilizing empirical knowledge of hotspots as a tool to fight crime have been hampered by uncertainty about the predictability of such patterns.
